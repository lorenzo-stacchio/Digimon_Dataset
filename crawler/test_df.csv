Abbadomon,https://wikimon.net/Abbadomon,,"A mysterious Digimon that evolved enormously by absorbing the negative data that the Network is overflowing with beyond its limit. Its raison d'Ãªtre is to transcend good and evil, and return everything to nothingness. It bites into Digimon and the Digital World itself with the large mouth at its center and the mouths on its numerous tentacles, and after doing so, only empty, blank data is left behind. The birth of Abbadomon is undoubtedly a crisis for the entire Digital World, and it is conjectured that some Digital Worlds from other dimensions have been annihilated by it. Its Special Moves are firing cursed beams from all of the eyes on its tentacles (Gaze Eraser), seizing the enemy with its tentacles and swallowing them whole with its central mouth (Gala-lightness), and additionally, firing a white beam from that mouth (White Liner); you will be erased the instant you suffer any of these techniques.",Abbadomon.jpg,https://wikimon.net/File:Abbadomon.jpg
